🚀 Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get your automation running locally:

1. Clone the Repository
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
2. Install Dependencies
Bash

npm install
3. Setup Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your configuration details:

Code snippet

# Gmail App Password Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# MongoDB Connection URI
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/companyDB
⚠️ IMPORTANT: You must use a Gmail App Password, not your regular Gmail password. To generate one:

Enable 2-Step Verification on your Google Account.

Navigate to the App Passwords section.

Select "Mail" as the app, choose a custom name (e.g., "Nodemailer"), and use the generated 16-character password for EMAIL_PASS.

4. Seed Sample Data
Run the seeder script to populate your MongoDB database with initial employee records:

Bash

node empData.js
5. Run the Automation Script
Execute the main script to check for today's birthdays and anniversaries and send the emails:

Bash

node anniversaryCheck.js
6. Schedule with Cron (For Automation)
To run this script daily at a specific time (e.g., 8:00 AM), set up a cron job on your server:

Bash

# Example cron job command (runs every day at 8:00 AM)
0 8 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/repo/anniversaryCheck.js
📧 Example Email Content
The script generates personalized emails with dynamic content:

Type	Example Subject	Example Body
Birthday	🎂 Happy Birthday, [Employee Name]!	Dear Rajesh Kumar, Wishing you a very Happy Birthday! Best Regards, Team
Anniversary	🎉 Happy Work Anniversary, [Employee Name]!	Dear Jane Doe, Wishing you a very Happy Work Anniversary! Best Regards, Team
